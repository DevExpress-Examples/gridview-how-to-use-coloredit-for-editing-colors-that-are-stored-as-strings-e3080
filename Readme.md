# GridView: How to use ColorEdit for editing colors that are stored as strings


<p>By default, ColorEdit works with Color type values. So, if your data source stores only string values, the ColorEdit will not be able to edit them. As a solution, you can use unbound columns, which will store converted values of the Color type. In this case, ColorEdit will work correctly. More information can be  found in the article <a href="http://documentation.devexpress.com/#WindowsForms/CustomDocument1477"><u>Unbound Columns</u></a>.</p>
